    Let’s talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us
      over <br> — and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest <br>
      fare. That’s why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on
      airfare, trying to game the system like we’re attempting to outsmart a
      used car salesman.<br><br>
    <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/">I’ve written about finding a cheap flight before </a> and even <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/booking-a-cheap-airfare-online/">my process for booking a flight</a>but today I want to talk about some persistent and inaccurate myths about booking a flight that have stuck around through simple inertia and lazy journalism.
